# 💼 Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting employee salaries using **machine learning algorithms**. Traditional methods often rely on limited factors and fail to capture complex patterns in data. Our approach leverages multiple features such as **experience, education, job role, and location** to provide accurate predictions.  

The system can help:  
- 📊 Employers design fair compensation structures  
- 👨‍💼 Job seekers make informed career decisions

## 🛠️ Methodology  

### 🔹 Workflow  
1. **Dataset Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Normalize/standardize features  

2. **Feature Selection**  
   - Select relevant attributes like experience, education, job role, industry, and location  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Algorithms used:  
     - Linear Regression  
     - Decision Trees  
     - Random Forest  
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score, Accuracy  

5. **Deployment**  
   - Best-performing model used for predictions
