# 💼 Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting employee salaries using **machine learning algorithms**. Traditional methods often rely on limited factors and fail to capture complex patterns in data. Our approach leverages multiple features such as **experience, education, job role, and location** to provide accurate predictions.  

The system can help:  
- 📊 Employers design fair compensation structures  
- 👨‍💼 Job seekers make informed career decisions
